## What is an RFID card, how can I get it and how do I use it?

An RFID card is more commonly known as a swipe card. Examples include hotel room cards, supermarket loyalty cards and work passes. If you have one, just register it via the Connected Kerb app.

Follow these easy steps to register and assign your own card to your account.
Registered RFID cards can then be used to initiate a charge at any of our charging points, however, you can only top up through the Connected Kerb app which is why we encourage you to use it for all your charging needs in order to get the best charging experience.

## What should I do if I lose my RFID card?

Go to “Menu” in the app, top left corner, go to RFID Cards and disable your lost card. You can then self-register an RFID card in the same menu.

## How do I cancel my account?

Tap drop down menu icon, top left corner of the app, then tap your account name, scroll down and tap “Remove account”. We would be sorry to see you leave and always welcome feedback. Please do not hesitate to call us at 0800 0291 696 or email us at support@smartkerb.com.
